After taking this training, I pledge to:

- Not run jobs on the head node
- Be wary of asking for too many compute nodes
- Be respectful of the lustre filesystem 
- Clear out lustre and don't leave files that are not going to be analyzed
- Try to divide my jobs into the smallest reasonable work units
- Clean up any temporary files after your job is complete
- Be considerate of other users on exacloud
